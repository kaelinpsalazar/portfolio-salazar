      My name is Kaelin Salazar, and I am a Software Developer based in Denver, Colorado. I graduated from the University of Kentucky with a B.S. in Environmental Sciences, and initially pursued a career in the chemistry field. After several years, I transitioned into a managerial role at a small startup in Boulder, where we produced organic dog treats. Now, I'm thrilled to have shifted to software development and am excited about the new opportunities ahead.
