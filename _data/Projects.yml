      - The backend, built with Ruby on Rails, follows RESTful API principles to manage user gardens and plant data, storing information in PostgreSQL.
      - The OpenAI API provides intelligent plant recommendations, while the Google Cloud API delivers images for those recommended plants.
      - On the frontend we developed an interactive React UI, allowing users to search for plants by hardiness zone, manage their gardens, and explore detailed plant information. API calls dynamically fetch and display data with a clean and responsive interface.
